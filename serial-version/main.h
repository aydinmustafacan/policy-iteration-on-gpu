/**
 * @file main.h
 * @brief Header file for the main MDP policy iteration program
 * 
 * This header provides the interface definitions for the main program
 * that solves Markov Decision Processes using policy iteration algorithms.
 * The program supports multiple input formats and automatically selects
 * appropriate solving strategies based on problem characteristics.
 * 
 * Program Architecture:
 * - Modular design with separate components for I/O, algorithms, and utilities
 * - Flexible input handling supporting JSON and CSV formats
 * - Automatic solver selection for optimal performance
 * - Comprehensive output generation for analysis and validation
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - sparse_policy_iteration.h: CSR-based sparse matrix algorithms
 * - json_reader.h: JSON parsing and data structure conversion
 *
 * @version 1.0
